# Ozirus's Dilemma: Predict, Decide, Prove

This repo holds a LaTeX paper and examples for **Ozirus's Dilemma**.

- **SDA**: predicts near-term risk and splits minutes across actions.
- **PCP**: turns the plan into small integers and checks with math.
- **RGM**: locks the plan with a Merkle root and a signature.
